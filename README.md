## How to set up Custom Search Engine API:
- Sign up for a [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) account.<br>A free account should be good enough. (?)
- Create a new credential in your [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Get the `API Key`. Restrict it to CSE.
- Visit the [Google Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/cse/all).
- Create a custom image search engine.<br>There are many great resources online on how to configure your engine.
- Get the `cx`.
- Paste your `API Key` and `cx` in the CSE config section of the program.
